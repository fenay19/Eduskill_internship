Pipeline 5 Notebook for training continuation - AutoAI Notebook v2.1.7\n\nConsider these tips for working with an auto-generated notebook:\n- Notebook code generated using AutoAI will execute successfully. If you modify the notebook, we cannot guarantee it will run successfully.\n- This pipeline is optimized for the original data set. The pipeline might fail or produce sub-optimal results if used with different data.  If you want to use a different data set, consider retraining the AutoAI experiment to generate a new pipeline. For more information, see <a href=\"https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/autoai-notebook.html\">Cloud Platform</a>. \n- Before modifying the pipeline or trying to re-fit the pipeline, consider that the code converts dataframes to numpy arrays before fitting the pipeline (a current restriction of the preprocessor pipeline).\n"}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "<a id=\"content\"></a>\n## Notebook content\n\nThis notebook contains code to resume and continue training an AutoAI pipeline partially trained in an AutoAI experiment.
